        <h2>Why a Cohesive Storyline Matters:</h2>
        <p>
          A well-crafted story is the heart of any great narrative, whether it's
          a novel, a screenplay, or a video game. It keeps your audience hooked
          and invested. But maintaining that consistency throughout can be
          tough. Those pesky plot holes can ruin the magic.
