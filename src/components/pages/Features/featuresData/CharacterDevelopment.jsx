        <h3>Main Components:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Character Description Input:</li>
          <p>
            Users can provide a brief character description to kickstart the
            creative process. For example, you might input details like{" "}
            <i> "John, 30 years old, space explorer,"</i> and the AI will
            generate a character bio based on these initial parameters.
          </p>
          <li>Character Biography Generation:</li>
          <p>
            The AI will analyze the input and generate a detailed character
            biography, bringing your character to life with information about
            their background, personality, goals, and more. This bio can serve
            as a foundation for your character, providing essential insights
            into their motivations and traits.
          </p>
          <li>Character Image Creation:</li>
          <p>
            {" "}
            In addition to the character biography, this feature allows users to
            create a visual representation of their character. Users can input
            specific physical attributes or let the AI generate an image based
            on the character's background and personality. This visual aid helps
            you better visualize your character and can serve as a reference
            when writing or illustrating your story.
          </p>
          <li>Customization and Refinement:</li>
          <p>
            Users can further refine and customize the character bio and image
            to align with their unique vision. This enables creators to add
            specific details and nuances to the character, making them even more
            tailored to their story.
          </p>
        </ul>
