          Storyboarding is a crucial pre-production step in the filmmaking
          process, providing a visual roadmap for directors, producers, and the
          entire creative team. Traditional storyboards involve static sketches
          or images that convey the sequence of scenes. However, the future of
          storyboarding has arrived with an innovative solution that leverages
          artificial intelligence and collaborative tools, transforming the way
          filmmakers plan their projects. This feature combines the traditional
          art of storyboarding with AI-enhanced capabilities, making it a
          game-changer for the industry.

          <li>AI-Generated Frame Images:</li>
          <p>
            Unlike conventional storyboards, this cutting-edge tool harnesses
            the power of AI to automatically generate frame images from text
            descriptions or scene ideas. Filmmakers can input their ideas in
            text form, and the AI system interprets and converts them into
            visually stunning frame images. This feature saves time, especially
            when sketching skills may be limited, and ensures that the
            director's vision is effectively communicated.

            To facilitate communication and annotations, the storyboard includes
            a "Sticky Notes" feature. Users can attach virtual notes to specific
            frames, providing additional context, instructions, or comments.
            This ensures that everyone involved in the project is on the same
            page and can easily communicate their thoughts and ideas.
