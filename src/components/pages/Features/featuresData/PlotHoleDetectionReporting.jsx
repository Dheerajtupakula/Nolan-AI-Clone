        <h3>Logical Consistency Check:</h3>
        <p>

          story, ensuring that the world-building and rules set by the author
          are consistently followed.
        </p>
        <p>

          such as changes in the rules of a fantasy world or unexplained shifts
          in the laws of science.
        </p>
        <h3>Character Plot Hole Detection:</h3>
        <p>

            Changes in a character's personality or motivation without adequate
            development or explanation.
          </li>
          <li>Contradictory actions or decisions made by a character.</li>
        </ul>

          conveniently change to serve the plot.
